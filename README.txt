Hi Michele,

 

Please find attached an excel file with peak areas in columns G-BE for the 47 metabolites of the “cytb signature” that were observed across samples. I reran this with the same processing settings as for the singlicate data shown in Figure 3A of the manuscript. Duplicates are labelled 1 and 1a, 2 and 2a, etc. The grouping is as follows if it helps:

 

Cytb inhibitors: samples 2, 6, 7, 12, 15, 17
Non-cytb inhibitors: 1, 3, 4, 5, 10, 11, 14, 16, 18, 19, 20
Other ox phos inhibitors: 8, 13
 

See you tomorrow.

 

Thanks,

Kenny
